## Weather Staion using LoRa on Arduino Pro Mini and ESP32

This project focuses on basic LoRa communications using Arduino.
-- Arduino Pro Mini will be used as a sender, sending data from temperature/humidity sensorn to the receiver. Using battery as a power source, with low power mode, can last up to months.
-- ESP32 will be used as a receiver. Data received from sender will be showed up on a small OLED screen. Using USB as power source.

Project is still WIP. Schematics will be updated later.
